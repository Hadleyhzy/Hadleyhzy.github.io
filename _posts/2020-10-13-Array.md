## 1.Array Definition
```c++
//Tree Declaration
struct TreeNode
{
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode():val(0),left(nullptr),right(nullptr){};
    TreeNode(int x):val(x),left(nullptr),right(nullptr){};
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode* l,TreeNode* r):val(x),left(l),right(r){};
};
//Tree Initializaiton with default value zero
TreeNode *root = new TreeNode(0, nullptr, nullptr);
```

## Array Basic Operation
### Rotate Array
* 189 Rotate Array([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/):[A](https://github.com/Hadleyhzy/data_structure_and_algorithm/blob/master/array/leetcode_array/189_rotate_array.cpp))

Note that reverse function range used is [first, last), which contains all the elements between first and last, including the element pointed by first but not the element pointed by last.

Complexity Linear in half the distance between first and last, swap elements.

## Topic
### Permutations

### Combinations
* 216 Combination Sum III([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-iii/):[A]())
* 39 Combination Sum([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/):[A]())
* 77 Combinations([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/combinations/):[A]())
Note that the subset we used when backtracking most cases should be passed as reference and pop_back during iteration.

### Array Sort
* 215 Kth Largest Element in an Array([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/):[A]())  
solution: nth_element, partial_sort, max heap, min heap
#### Difference between nth_element and partial_sort
nth_element rearranges the nth position element in a sorted sequence, complexity on average is linear in the distance between first and last.
partial_sort rearranges elements before the middle and sorted while remaining elements are left without any specific order. Complexity: Nlog(M) where N is this distance and M is the distance between first and middle.
