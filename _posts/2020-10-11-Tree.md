## 1.Tree Definition
```c++
//Tree Declaration
struct TreeNode
{
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode():val(0),left(nullptr),right(nullptr){};
    TreeNode(int x):val(x),left(nullptr),right(nullptr){};
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode* l,TreeNode* r):val(x),left(l),right(r){};
};
//Tree Initializaiton with default value zero
TreeNode *root = new TreeNode(0, nullptr, nullptr);
```

## 2.Binary Search Tree
### 2.1 Binary Search Tree Definition  
Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has following structures:
* The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
* The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys larger than the node's key.
*  The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.

### BST Traversal
#### Inorder Traversal
BFS Solution:
``` c++
BSTIterator(TreeNode* root) {
        //create queue to store all node value in inorder sequence
        queue<int> q;
        if(!root)return;
        stack<TreeNode*> s;
        s.push(root);

        TreeNode *node=s.top()->left;
        while(!s.empty()||node){

            while(node){
                s.push(node);
                node=node->left;
            }
            q.push(s.top()->val);

            if(s.top()->right){
                node=s.top->right;
            }
            s.pop();
        }
}
```
* 173 binary search tree iterator(BFS)(stack/queue)
* 230 Kth Smallest Element in a BST(BFS/DFS)([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/solution/):[A]())
* 98 Validate Binary Search Tree([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/solution/):[A]())(BFS inorder traversal, DFS by setting lower and upper limit)

Note that when comparing integer type value with long type value, an object of type `int`  is always converted to the type long because type long has higher rank than type `int`.

#### Preorder Traversal(root->left->right)
* 199 Binary Tree Right Side View([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-right-side-view/):[A]())(BFS)(DFS->preorder traversal)

#### Postorder Traversal(left->right->root)

#### Validate BST

### Binary Tree Basic Operation
#### Leaf

#### Sum

#### Height

#### Nodes
* Count Complete Tree Nodes([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/):[A]())(DFS, Binary Search)


#### BST Ancestor
* 236 Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/):[A]())
* 235 Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/):[A]())

Note that if task is to need to traverse all nodes of binary tree meanwhile see if any nodes could fulfill requirements of tasks, then adding a new private result value and return state of every nodes during DFS.

### 2.3 Binary Search Tree Construction:
* 96 Unique Binary Search Trees ([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees/):[A](https://github.com/Hadleyhzy/data_structure_and_algorithm/blob/master/tree/leetcode_tree/96_unique_binary_search_tree.cpp))(DFS)

* 95 Unique Binary Search Tree_II ([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees-ii/):[A](https://github.com/Hadleyhzy/data_structure_and_algorithm/blob/master/tree/leetcode_tree/95_unique_binary_search_tree_2.cpp))(DP)

* 106 Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and PostOrder Traversal([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-inorder-and-postorder-traversal/):[A]())

Ust two pointers to track range of inorder of current node, one or two pointer/index to track root of postorder of current node, note that traverse post order from right to left.
{:.warning}



### 2.4 Path
* 113 Path Sum II([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-ii/):[A](https://github.com/Hadleyhzy/data_structure_and_algorithm/blob/master/tree/leetcode_tree/113_path_sum_3.cpp))(DFS)


### 2.5 Modify Tree Data Structure
#### 2.5.1 Flatten Binary Tree(DFS):
* 114 Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-binary-tree-to-linked-list/):[A](https://github.com/Hadleyhzy/data_structure_and_algorithm/blob/master/tree/leetcode_tree/114_flatten_bianry_tree_to_linked_list.cpp))   

Since every depth search we need tail of left subtree to be connected to top of right subtree, return tail of every flatten root is necessary.
{:.info}

Don't forget to set root left tree to be nullptr.
{:.warning}

#### 2.5.2 Next Pointer
* 116 Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node/):[A](https://github.com/Hadleyhzy/data_structure_and_algorithm/blob/master/tree/leetcode_tree/116_populating_next_right_pointers_in_each_node.cpp))  

We need to build 'next' connection between four tree nodes from their two root tree nodes.
{:.info}

Given dicussion above, dfs function would be like:
```c++
    void func(TreeNode* left, TreeNode *right){}
```

* 117 Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node-ii/):[A](https://github.com/Hadleyhzy/data_structure_and_algorithm/blob/master/tree/leetcode_tree/117_populating_next_right_pointers_in_each_node_2.cpp))  

Note that better solution would be breadth first search since it's not perfect binary tree.
